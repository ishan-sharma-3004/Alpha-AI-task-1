# Alpha-AI-task-1
# Image segmentation and crowd counting 


Taking into consideration this was my first time working with deep learning frameworks I could finish only 1 of the tow tasks given 

Both the codes are working for image segmentation I took help from research papers and youtube to gather all the neessary information and the second code is just a
replication of one of the codes I got from github but changes according to the image I chose which I will be mentioning in the files above.
Given a little more time I could have integrated these separate codes and also could have done the second task.
