# Alpha-AI-task-2
# Image segmentation and crowd counting 


Taking into consideration this was my first time working with deep learning frameworks I could finish only 1 of the tow tasks given 

I have given the code as a py file not as pynb beacuse it was not working in my system and a full diagnostic would have taken a lot of time which I invested on research for the algo's and content to do the task
Both the codes are working for image segmentation I took help from research papers and youtube to gather all the neessary information and the second code is just a
replication of one of the codes I got from github but changes according to the image I chose which I will be mentioning in the files above.
Given a little more time I could have integrated these separate codes and also could have done the second task also.
Thank you for providing me with these wonderfull projects to learn from.
